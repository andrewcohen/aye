// The list of workspaces, and which of them can be opened.
//
// Two lines per row, and the rules below are the Go deck's — see
// `archive/internal/deckui/sidebar.go`, which is around sixty percent prose
// about exactly this strip. They are worth taking rather than rediscovering,
// and each one is here because something was tried and read badly.
//
//   ● pr-2340-lantern-header-header-allowlist
//     rowan · agent
//
//   ● effect-ts-tabular-export-timemachine
//     rowan · agent editor action_dev
//
// **Two lines, always.** A row has two unrelated facts to carry — which
// workspace, and what is in it — and on one line they compete: the kinds are
// short and go last, so the name is what truncates, and a truncated name is the
// one field you cannot work out from the others. Given a line to itself the
// name gets the whole column. The cadence has to be fixed to be a cadence, so
// the second line always says something; a name with nothing under it reads as
// a one-line row and the rhythm is gone.
//
// **Colour marks structure, not content.** One dot per row carries a hue and
// nothing else on the row does. The second line is the line there is one of per
// row, so a colour on it is a colour repeated down the whole column — and
// emphasis spent everywhere is emphasis nowhere.
//
// **A workspace called `default` is the repository's**, and the word says
// nothing: six projects with one workspace each would render as six rows
// reading `default`. So the project is the name and `default` goes below it,
// which is the same trade in both directions — line two is whichever half of
// project/workspace line one did not use.
//
// ── threads sit above all of this ──────────────────────────────────────────
// The strip is a list of threads, each holding its workspaces, and one group at
// the end for everything no thread has claimed. The nesting is one level and
// stays one level: a workspace row already carries two lines, and a third level
// of indent would spend the name's column on structure.
//
// A thread heading is a heading, not a row — it does not open anything, because
// a thread has nothing to open. What it has is a `+`, which is the only way to
// make a workspace from this window.
//
// The loose group is not a thread with a blank name. It has no `+` and no
// title to edit, and `ThreadGroup.thread === undefined` is what makes that a
// type error rather than something to remember.

// One rule of the Go strip is deliberately **not** taken: it drops a
// `pr-1234-` prefix from a name because the number is on the line below. Here
// there is no PR number on any line, so dropping it would lose the only place
// that information appears.
//
// Air between rows is a margin rather than a blank row. The Go strip paid a
// third of its height for that separation because a terminal has no smaller
// unit than a line; this one does not have to.
