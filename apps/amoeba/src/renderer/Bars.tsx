// The two strips the columns sit between.
//
// The columns used to run edge to edge, top to bottom, which meant anything the
// window had to say about *itself* — which session is open, whether the daemon
// is there, what the jobs are doing — had to be borrowed from a column that was
// already spoken for. The sidebar ended up carrying the appearance toggle in a
// footer for exactly that reason.
//
// Two consequences worth stating, because both replaced something:
//
//   - **The top bar clears the traffic lights, so no column has to.** The
//     window is `hiddenInset`, so the controls float over the top-left of the
//     content; every column used to start with `space.titlebar` of padding to
//     stay out of their way, in three places, none of which knew why. Now one
//     strip does it — and it clears them by going *under* them rather than
//     starting to their right, which is what lets the leftmost control have
//     the window's real left edge. See `top` below for the six pixels that
//     forced the change.
//   - **The top bar is the window's drag handle.** With the controls hidden
//     there is no title bar to grab, and a strip of chrome with nothing
//     interactive in it is the natural place — which is also why nothing
//     interactive goes in it.
//
// Neither bar scrolls or grows. They are `flex-shrink: 0` in a column layout,
// so the middle row is the only thing that flexes and the no-top-level-scroll
// rule in global.css still holds when the window gets short.

/**
 * The narrowest the corner strip is allowed to get.
 *
 * The traffic lights own the first 5.25rem and two fold controls follow them,
 * so a strip narrower than this puts a button under a light. It is a floor and
 * not a width: while the sidebar is open the strip matches it, and a seam that
 * moved when the sidebar was dragged would read as a rendering fault.

// ── how a window with no title bar is actually moved ──────────────────────

// `-webkit-app-region: drag` is emitted by StyleX and does nothing. Electrobun
// does not read CSS for it; its preload matches on the DOM, and on two things
// only:
//
//   target.closest('[style*="app-region"][style*="drag"]')   an INLINE style
//   target.closest(".electrobun-webkit-app-region-drag")     its own class
//
// StyleX produces neither — it produces a class of its own and a rule in a
// stylesheet. So the property has never moved this window. It moved because
// `hiddenInset` leaves a real title bar behind the strip, and AppKit was doing
// the work; the note in AGENTS.md claiming otherwise was checking that the CSS
// was emitted, which it is, rather than that anything reads it.
//
// That mattered the moment the title bar went away. With `titleBarStyle:
// "hidden"` there is no native region left, so without the class below the
// window cannot be moved at all.
//
// The CSS property is kept as well as the class. It costs nothing, it is the
// standard spelling, and it is what a different host would read.

  // The top bar goes *under* the traffic lights rather than beside them.
  //
  // It used to start 5.25rem in, to clear them sideways. That worked and put
  // our leftmost control six pixels from the OS's rightmost one, so the eye
  // grouped it with close/minimise/zoom — a fourth traffic light that folds a
  // column. Measured, because "it looks cramped" is not a number:
  //
  //   traffic lights end   78px
  //   our toggle starts    84px      ← six pixels of daylight
  //
  // There is no fixing that in the same row. The accessory's toggle can sit at
  // its column's outer edge because that edge is the window's right side and
  // nothing is there; the mirror of that for the sidebar is the window's left
  // side, which AppKit owns. So the bar takes the whole width and starts below
  // the band instead, and the leftmost control gets the real edge it was after.
  //
  // The band is empty on purpose. It is the drag handle, and a strip of chrome
  // with nothing interactive in it is exactly what a drag handle should be.
  // ── one row, and the title is centred on the window ─────────────────────
  //
  // This was two bands stacked: a 28px strip under the traffic lights holding
  // the title, and a 28px row below it holding the fold controls. That was
  // 57px of chrome to say one word, and the title was centred in the *upper
  // half* rather than in the bar — which is what "center it vertically" was
  // about, and the two-band split is the only reason it could not be.

  //           └──────────────┘ 57
  //
  // **The left control still cannot reach the window's edge.** The window is
  // `hiddenInset`, so AppKit floats the traffic lights over the first 78px and
  // this bar's start padding is what clears them — six pixels of daylight at
  // 84px. That constraint is why the two bands existed; what changed is the
  // answer to it. Giving the control the real edge cost a whole row of chrome
  // and put the title off centre, and the edge was worth neither.
  // ── and then it stopped spanning the window ──────────────────────────────
  //
  // "let the panes go all the way to the top again". A full-width strip is
  // forty pixels the agent and the panels do not get, spent on a constraint
  // that is only true of the window's left corner: AppKit floats the traffic
  // lights over the first 84px, and nothing else up there needs clearing.

  //

          because it was then the only way back. That worked and was hard to
          find — an affordance that is invisible until the pointer is already
          on a one-pixel rule is one nobody discovers, and it could not be
          pressed at all without a pointer.

          The top bar is the one strip that never folds, so it is where a
          control that folds something else belongs.

          **Each one sits at the edge it folds.** Both were at the right end
          together, which put the sidebar's control as far from the sidebar as
          the window allows and left the two of them to be told apart by a
          mirrored glyph alone. Now the icon's mirror and its position say the
          same thing, and neither is carrying the distinction by itself.

          The left one cannot go further left than this: the window is
          `hiddenInset`, so the traffic lights float over the first 5.25rem and
