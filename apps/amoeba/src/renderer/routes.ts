// Where the window is, as an address rather than a variable.
//
// ── what this replaced, and why that was wrong ─────────────────────────────
// Selection used to be one string of React state — the *session name* — kept
// across reloads by hand in localStorage. Three things were wrong with it, and
// only the last one is really about routing.
//
//   1. There was no back. Opening a workspace threw away which one you had
//      been looking at, and the window had no memory of it.
//   2. `remembered.ts` was persistence hand-rolled for exactly the thing a
//      history already keeps.
//   3. A session name is a SHORTENED address, and cannot be split back into
//      its parts.
//
// The third is the argument. AGENTS.md states the rule at length: `sessionName`
// gives the stem whatever budget the kind does not need, so two sessions of one
// workspace are shortened to different stems, and reading a name back is
// guessing. The daemon already sends the unshortened truth as `SessionIdentity`
// — and the old selection threw it away, storing the shortened form and then
// searching the listing for a name equal to it.
//
// A route stores the truth instead:
//
//   before   selected = "awp.thicket.effect-ts-tabular-expor-ca90.agent"
//   after    /w/thicket/effect-ts-tabular-export-timemachine/agent
//
// The second survives a session being restarted under a different shortening.
// The first does not, and that is a real failure rather than a tidiness point.
//
// ── the shape of the tree, and why it is flat ──────────────────────────────
// One route level, and no `Outlet`. The window's layout does not change with
// the address — the same two bars and three columns are on screen whatever is
// selected, and only the pane's contents differ. A nested route rendering a
// different component tree would be modelling a screen change that does not
// happen, and would then have to hand the session list back down through it.
//
// So the root renders the whole window and reads the address; the leaf routes
// exist to *type and parse* it. That is the whole job, and it is enough of one.
//
// ── hash history ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The window loads the renderer from a dev server in development and from the
// app's own `app://` scheme in a build, and only one of those is a server that
// would rewrite a deep path back to index.html. A hash needs nothing to agree
// with it, and still pushes real entries onto the session history, so back and
// forward work.
