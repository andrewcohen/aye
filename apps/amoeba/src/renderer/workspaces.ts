// A workspace has one session per kind — an agent, an editor, whatever user
// actions are configured — and every one of them is a separate zmx session with
// its own name. Listing those names and labelling each with its workspace is
// how three rows read `rowan.default` and two of them were the same place:
//
//   awp.rowan.default.agent   ┐
//   awp.rowan.default.editor  ┘ →  "rowan.default", twice
//
// The identity comes off the wire rather than out of the name. Splitting a name
// on dots looks like it answers this and does not: a name is shortened when it
// would exceed what zmx accepts, and a dot inside a real project name comes back
// as an underscore. The daemon has the labels awp wrote, which are the
// unshortened truth — see SessionIdentity in the protocol.
