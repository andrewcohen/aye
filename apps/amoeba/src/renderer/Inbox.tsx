// the rows inside them all arrive decided — see `inbox.ts` in the daemon — so
// this file is only about what a row says and what pressing it does.
//
// ── what a row has to carry, and what it must not ─────────────────────────
//
//   #2340 tabular exports for checkout          ← the identity, and the words
//   thicket · someone · feature/discounts        ← where, whose, which branch
//
// Two lines, the same rule as the workspace strip above it and for the same
// reason: the title is the field that can be arbitrarily long and the one that
// cannot be reconstructed from the others, so it gets a line to itself.
//
// **The number is monospace and the title is not.** A PR number is an address —
// somebody will type it into `gh` or read it out — and the two families in this
// window are split on exactly that line. It is also the one place a row points
// outside the window, which is why it is allowed the accent.
//
// **A chip only appears when it says something.** A green row shows no CI chip
// at all: "passing" on every row is a column of the same word, and a column of
// the same word is one the eye stops reading — which costs the one row where it
// says something else. The chips are therefore all bad news, plus the two
// states that are neither ("draft", "blocked").
//
// ── pressing a row ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One action, and which one it is depends on a record rather than on a mode:
//
//   no workspace yet   review  → a thread and a workspace, in the background
//   already reviewing  open    → go to its agent
//
// The daemon is what makes that safe: `ReviewStart` answers with the same
// thread and job when the work is already under way, so a second press is not a
// second workspace. See its doc in the contract for the two records that
// guarantee it. The row does not have to know, and deliberately does not track
// what it has started — a window reloaded mid-create would forget, and the
// daemon would not.
