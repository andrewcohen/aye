// v4 folds rpc into core, so the import is `effect/unstable/rpc` and there is
// no `@effect/rpc` in the tree — that package is the v3 line and peers on
// `effect ^3.22.1`. Depending on both would put two Effect runtimes in one
// workspace, which does not fail like a version problem: two runtimes means two
// sets of Context tags, so a service provided through one is simply not found
// by the other. `test/deps.test.ts` guards it.
//
// `unstable/` is upstream's own label for the surface. Absorbing its churn is
// this package's job: a rename upstream touches this file rather than every
// call site in the daemon and the renderer.
