// The RPC contract between an awp client and the daemon.
//
// One file, and it is the whole agreement. The daemon implements what is
// declared here and the renderer calls it; both derive their types from these
// same values, so a change to a payload is a compile error on both sides rather
// than a runtime surprise on one. That property is the reason this package
// exists as its own thing rather than living in the daemon.
//
// ── why effect/unstable/rpc ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// v4 folds rpc into core, so the import is `effect/unstable/rpc` and there is
// no `@effect/rpc` in the tree — that package is the v3 line and peers on
// `effect ^3.22.1`. Depending on both would put two Effect runtimes in one
// workspace, which does not fail like a version problem: two runtimes means two
// sets of Context tags, so a service provided through one is simply not found
// by the other. `test/deps.test.ts` guards it.
//
// `unstable/` is upstream's own label for the surface. Absorbing its churn is
// this package's job: a rename upstream touches this file rather than every
// call site in the daemon and the renderer.
