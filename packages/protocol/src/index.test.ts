// A contract is only a contract if it survives the wire.

// Two different questions here, and conflating them would leave a hole:
// RpcTest connects a client straight to the handlers through the
// *no-serialization* path, so it proves the shapes, the streaming and the
// failure channel — but it never encodes anything. Anything that could not be
// represented as JSON would sail through it untouched. So the codec gets its
// own tests, run through `Schema.toCodecJson`, which is precisely what the
// transport's `RpcSerialization.json` uses.
