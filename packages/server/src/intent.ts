// Turning "add tabular exports to checkout" into the arguments for a workspace.
//
// One headless model call, answering with JSON. Ported from the Go
// implementation's workspace_intent.go, whose shape is worth taking whole
// because three of its decisions are not obvious.
//
// ── the model chooses, it does not author ──────────────────────────────────
// Every field is checked against something local before it is used. That is
// what makes it safe to act on an answer nobody read first.
//
// ── the JSON is fished out, not parsed ─────────────────────────────────────
// "Answer with JSON and nothing else" is a request, not a guarantee. Measured
// 2026-08-26: with a global CLAUDE.md in place, a reply came back beginning
// "Dearest Mister Duck," before the object, and another wrapped it in a ```json
// fence. So the outermost braces are located and the rest discarded.
//
// ── the flags are a trap ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `--tools`, `--mcp-config` and `--allowed-tools` are **variadic**, so a prompt
// that follows one is swallowed as another value for it. `claude -p --tools ""
// "$PROMPT"` makes the prompt a tool name, leaves no prompt, and exits 1 with
// empty output. Every flag here is written `--flag=value` for that reason, and
// the prompt is always last.
//
// Measured while getting that wrong three times: disabling tools does **not**
// make the call faster (12.6s vs 13.7s median over four runs each — inside the
// noise). It is passed because a naming call that cannot reach for Bash is one
// that cannot do anything surprising, which is a better reason than speed.

 * A name made here, for when the model cannot be reached.
 *
 * ── why there is a fallback at all ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The naming call is a subprocess that runs `claude`, takes about twelve
 * seconds, and needs a network. Every one of those can be missing — on a
 * train, behind a captive portal, while the vendor is having a bad afternoon —
 * and what a person asked for was a workspace, not a name. Refusing the whole
 * job because the *label* could not be composed loses the work over the
 * caption on it.
 *
 * ── what it is not ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not a second namer competing with the model. It takes the words a person
 * already typed and makes them into a directory name, which is the mechanical
 * part of the job; what the model adds is reading the sentence, and nothing
 * here pretends to.
 *
 *   "add tabular exports to checkout"  →  add-tabular-exports
 *   "fix the 500 on /api/orders"        →  fix-the-500-on-api
 *   "   "                               →  workspace
 *
 * Four words, because a workspace name is a path segment and part of a session
 * name, and the shortening that makes a long one fit is what makes it
 * unreadable. The label keeps the whole sentence — a label has room.
 *
 * Deterministic, and that matters more than it looks: the job step is safe to
 * run twice, so a retry after a failed later step must produce the same name
 * rather than a second workspace beside the first.
