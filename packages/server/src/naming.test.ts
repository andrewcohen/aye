// These prove properties rather than re-asserting what the Go implementation
// did. The Go code is evidence that a rule was once right, not proof that it
// is — so what is checked here is the behaviour the rest of the system relies
// on, which would still have to hold if the implementation were rewritten.
//
// What CANNOT be proved here is anything that is a claim about zmx itself.
// Those went to `bun run probe:claims`, which measured them on 2026-08-25: the
// 46-character limit holds (47 is refused, and zmx names its own max), and a
// name containing a slash is refused *silently* — no error, no session, nothing
// to notice. Only the arrow marking the caller's own session is still untested,
// because observing it means running inside a session and the probe refuses to.

// A corpus with the shapes that actually occur, including the pair the Go
// comment names as the reason shortening cannot be plain truncation.
