// The multiplexer: "there are sessions, and here is what you can ask about

//
// ── what a tag is ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `Multiplexer` below is a *tag*: a typed key naming a capability, with no
// implementation. Code that needs it writes `yield* Multiplexer` and its type
// gains `Multiplexer` in the third slot of `Effect<A, E, R>` — a debt the
// compiler carries upward until something provides an implementation. Forget to
// wire one and it is a type error rather than a crash.
//
// The debt is why this file has no zmx in it. zmx.ts provides one
// implementation; a test provides another. Neither is named here.
//
// ── what is deliberately NOT here ──────────────────────────────────────────
// `attach`. Everything on this service answers a question and costs nothing;
// attach is an act with a consequence — it opens a client, and a session takes
// its size from the client looking at it, so attaching reflows whatever is
// running in there. That line is also the line between "testable from inside a
// session" and "must run outside zmx", which makes it worth a separate tag.

 * three workspaces, which is what the sidebar showed. Nothing about that is a
 * bug in the shortening: a name is an address, and the address only has to
 * resolve, not to be legible.
 *
 * So the repair is the use `stemMatches` was written for — asked per workspace
 * rather than looked up in a map, because only the workspace can reproduce the
 * shortening at the length a given stem actually has. One labelled session is
 * enough to recover every one of its siblings.
