 * A batch of comments, as one thing to say to an agent.

 * This is the only place a review becomes language, and what it looks like
 * decides whether the agent can act on it. Three rules, each of which is a
 * mistake avoided rather than a preference:
 *
 * **Grouped by file, in file order.** Six comments across three files read as
 * three pieces of work; the same six interleaved read as six. An agent given a
 * flat list opens the same file three times.
 *
 * **The anchor is `path:line`, not prose.** That is the form every tool in the
 * agent's hands already takes — it can be pasted into an editor, a grep, a jump
 * — and a sentence like "in the third function of the sidebar" is a thing it
 * has to resolve before it can start.
 *
 * **The side is named only when it is a deletion.** Almost every comment is on
 * a line that is being added or kept, and saying "on the added line" against
 * every one of them is a phrase repeated down the whole prompt. Saying it for
 * the rare case is what makes it carry information.
 *
 * The heading says how many and stops. An agent counts as well as anyone, and a
 * paragraph of framing before the content is a paragraph it has to read past.
