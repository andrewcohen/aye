 * mistake avoided rather than a preference:
 *
 * **Grouped by file, in file order.** Six comments across three files read as
 * three pieces of work; the same six interleaved read as six. An agent given a
 * flat list opens the same file three times.
 *
 * **The anchor is `path:line`, not prose.** That is the form every tool in the
 * agent's hands already takes — it can be pasted into an editor, a grep, a jump
 * — and a sentence like "in the third function of the sidebar" is a thing it
 * has to resolve before it can start.
 *
 * **The side is named only when it is a deletion.** Almost every comment is on
 * a line that is being added or kept, and saying "on the added line" against
 * every one of them is a phrase repeated down the whole prompt. Saying it for
 * the rare case is what makes it carry information.
 *
 * The heading says how many and stops. An agent counts as well as anyone, and a
 * paragraph of framing before the content is a paragraph it has to read past.

       *   the file    ~/.awp/workspace-state.json, written by Claude Code
       *               hooks in the Go implementation. Knows about the agent
       *               running in a workspace's TERMINAL.
       *   the chat    this daemon's own ACP conversations. Knows about the
       *               agent in THIS WINDOW.
       *
       * A workspace can have both, so this is a precedence and not an
       * override. The chat reports only `working` and `waiting` — never
       * `idle` — precisely so that a chat nobody is using cannot claim the
       * terminal's agent has stopped.
       *
       *   waiting   a question somebody has to answer. Wins outright: it is
       *             the one state that is about the person rather than the
       *             machine, and it is the reason the strip has a colour at
       *             all.
       *   working   wins over whatever the file last said, because the file
       *             is a hook's last write and this is live.
       *   absent    the file's own answer stands, unchanged.
       *
       * Merged in the daemon for the same reason the project list is: only
       * this process holds both halves, and a client re-deriving the rule
       * would be a second implementation of it.
